**Project Overview:**
<br>
This is a simple command-line based User Authentication System implemented in Python. The system allows users to register with a username, password, email, and phone number, and later log in using their credentials. The program ensures basic validation during registration, such as checking for password confirmation and ensuring the phone number is exactly 10 digits.
